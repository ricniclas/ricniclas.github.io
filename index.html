        <section class="about-text">
          <p>
            Having graduated in Digital Game Development from college, I continued my career as an Android developer in the field of Information Security. Currently, I work as a Unity developer, creating medical simulations.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a game developer, I follow the best software development practices to
            maintain projects organized and expansive, as well as the implementation
            of external tools to supply the application functionalities such as servers
            (NodeJS), database (MySQL), and audio interface (FMOD).
          </p>

          <p>
            I also have experience as a technical artist, creating shaders using Shader
            Graph and HLSL, special effects using VFX Graph, Post Processing,
            Renderer Features, as well as creating supplementary meshes for VFX
            using Maya.

                College was my starting point as a developer, where I developed
                programming skills in several languages such as Python, Java, and mainly
                C# with a focus on Unity development. It was also where I started my first
